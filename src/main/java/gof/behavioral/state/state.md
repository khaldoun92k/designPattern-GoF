# State 

State design pattern is used when an Object change its behavior based on its internal state.

### Example 
TV Remote ON/OFF
TVRemoteBasic --(Apply State design pattern)--> TVRemote 

### State Design Pattern Benefits
The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is clearly visible.
The chances of error are less and itâ€™s very easy to add more states for additional behavior. Thus making our code more robust, easily maintainable and flexible. Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario. State Pattern is very similar to Strategy Pattern,
